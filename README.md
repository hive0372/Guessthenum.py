Guess the Number Game ðŸŽ²

This is a simple Python-based command-line game where the user guesses a randomly generated target number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback on whether the guesses are too high, too low, or correct. It continues until the user either guesses the correct number or decides to quit.

How to Play
The program generates a random integer between 1 and 100.
You will be prompted to enter a guess or type "Q" to quit the game.
After each guess, the program provides feedback:
If the guess is correct, the game ends with a success message.
If the guess is too low, it prompts you to guess a larger number.
If the guess is too high, it prompts you to guess a smaller number.
If you decide to quit, type "Q" to exit.
